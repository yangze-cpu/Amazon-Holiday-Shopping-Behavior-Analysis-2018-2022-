This project analyzes over 1.8 million Amazon purchase records (2018–2022) and 5,000+ survey responses to identify which consumer segments drive U.S. holiday spending surges. Focusing on Thanksgiving and Christmas, the analysis reveals that Christmas spending is primarily gift-driven and emotion-based, showing a temporary drop in 2020 followed by a strong recovery. While the East Coast maintains higher overall spending, the gap with the West has narrowed, signaling increasing regional parity in shopping activity. Product-level data highlight Electronics (+40%), Home (+28%), and Outdoor (+23%) as the fastest-growing categories, reflecting lifestyle- and family-oriented purchases rather than essentials. A key finding unique to this analysis is that middle-income female consumers aged 25–44 are the most stable yet impactful contributors to holiday revenue, concentrated in the South (38.6%) and showing consistent basket sizes despite income variation. Together, these insights position this group as the most representative and resilient target for holiday campaigns, guiding regionally adaptive and data-driven marketing strategies for future seasonal planning.
